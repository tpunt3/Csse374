Software Design

Our design somewhat mirrors the car example from class. We have a model that gets created through ASM. This model looks through the specified classes and generates our model based on the classes, methods, and fields it finds. We then traverse our model and generate a .gv file by going through all of the classes, fields, and methods in our model.
